<p name="a102" id="a102" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3">“Watch movies from streaming sites?”, I said when I saw my sister watch the Korean TV show called “Running Man” a year ago.</p>
<p name="c732" id="c732" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In this article, let me talk about what a Thai streaming site is, how it is popular in Thailand and why I do not watch online movies from that website.</p>
<p name="ceb7" id="ceb7" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">A Streaming site is a kind of websites used for watching online movies. There are many movies you can choose to watch. For example, if I want to watch movies, which is called <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“The Avengers”</strong>, I can watch by googling, clicking and waiting the computer to download a part of the movie for less than minutes.</p>
<p name="4519" id="4519" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Thailand, approximately ten years ago, many people buy movies from the shop in Pantip Plaza or Fortune Town because of low-speed internet.</p>
<p name="bf14" id="bf14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">About six years ago, internet is faster and people tend not to go outside. They watch movies by using BitTorrent. However, there are many factors impacting download speed such as seeding and leeching. The more people seed, the faster you get.</p>
<p name="56cc" id="56cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Nowadays, people do not want to wait for many hours to watch movies and do not want to know how many people are seeding at the moment. They change from using BitTorrent to download movies to watch movies from streaming sites. Sometimes, you do not need to watch from those websites. You can watch from YouTube instead.</p>
<p name="6274" id="6274" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I think it is good idea to watch movies from streaming sites, but I do not watching movies from those streaming websites for three reasons.</p>
<p name="4c5d" id="4c5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, it is illegal. All movies those streaming websites provide are unauthorised by publishers. Owners and volunteers upload movies which is downloaded from other websites, recorded in the cinema by using camcorders and ripped from offline media. According to copyright law of Thailand, streaming unauthorised movies is illegal.</p>
<p name="1b95" id="1b95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, it provides low resolution. Many online movies upload low resolution movies because it makes file small, and people do not want to wait downloading for long time. Then, watching movies take less time downloading, and bandwidth. From my perspective, you should watch high resolution movie instead.</p>
<p name="1b1e" id="1b1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Third, it does not support publishers. Streaming sites do not buy license to provide movies, and owners do not have enough money to pay. Although, almost every sites have advertisement, they do not pay any money to publishers. Thus, publishers cannot make any profit, and it affects them not to release movies in countries which have high piracy rate.</p>
<p name="e376" id="e376" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Three above reasons are enough for me not to open illegal streaming sites to watch.</p>
<p name="51b5" id="51b5" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">In my opinion, I recommend the better way to watch online movies by using services such as <a href="https://www.goprimetime.tv/" data-href="https://www.goprimetime.tv/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prime Time</a>, <a href="http://www.nickuntitled.com/blog/www.hollywood-hdtv.com/" data-href="http://www.nickuntitled.com/blog/www.hollywood-hdtv.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollywood HD</a> and <a href="http://www.doonung.com/" data-href="http://www.doonung.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Doonang</a>, which you can watch unlimited movies by paying few Baht each month.</p>
