  <p>Some parts of this article is already written in Thai language in this article to <a href="https://nickuntitled.com/2021/03/04/ipad-as-a-programming-laptop-replacement/">bring iPad as the development machine</a>.</p>

<p>Nowadays, you can create the remote development machine to replace the laptop and the tablet to develop anymore without hassles by the advances in cloud computing like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Microsoft Azure</a>, and the cloud-based IDE such as Cloud9, code-server, etc. However, on that day, the cost of the creation of the server was expensive. It counted many bucks per hour. For me, I considered not to create until this year.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-can-i-find-out-this-way">How can I find out this way?</h2>

<p>I see the old article about <a href="https://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">bringing the iPad for remote web development</a> by renting Linode as the development server. I found that it is more convenient. You don’t need to buy a newer and faster computer. You can just scale up or scale down for your needs.</p>

<p>I found a cheaper way to create the development server. I find the cheaper virtual private server (VPS) in my country like ReadyIDC, and I find the free self-hosted cloud IDE like code-server. You may feel a little confused about what code-server is.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server">code-server</a> (or VS code in the browser) is the self-hosted cloud IDE invented by <a href="https://coder.com/">Coder</a>. It has three advantages (from that Github page):</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Code on any device with a consistent development environment.</li><li>Use cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.</li><li>Preserve battery life when you’re on the go; all intensive tasks run on your server.</li></ol>

<p>I find that it fits with my lifestyle. I bring the laptop or the tablet between home and the campus. I find that it is inconvenient to transfer files between these devices. I consider installation on the remote server.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-can-i-install-code-server">How can I install code-server?</h2>

<p>I install code-server by running the Docker container. You can easily run the container by using this command below provided on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/codercom/code-server">the Docker hub page</a> as an example.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># This will start a code-server container and expose it at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
# It will also mount your current directory into the container as `/home/coder/project`
# and forward your UID/GID so that all file system operations occur as your user outside
# the container.
#
# Your $HOME/.config is mounted at $HOME/.config within the container to ensure you can
# easily access/modify your code-server config in $HOME/.config/code-server/config.json
# outside the container.
mkdir -p ~/.config
docker run -it --name code-server -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -v "$HOME/.config:/home/coder/.config" \
  -v "$PWD:/home/coder/project" \
  -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -e "DOCKER_USER=$USER" \
  codercom/code-server:latest</code></pre>

<p>Then, you save this file and run this script. It will show that the code-server is running. You can run the code-server by typing localhost:8080 to access it. However, it is not secure. It is better to use HTTPS..</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-use-https">How to use HTTPS?</h2>

<p>For me, I install Nginx and Certbot to reverse proxy to the code-server, and to get the SSL certificate from Let’s encrypt. Both are available as Docker containers. You can install, and configure it as a Docker-compose configuration file.</p>

<p>I wrote the Nginx configuration shown below as an example. Many parts are generated by Certbot.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>server {
    server_name &lt;Your Domain Name&gt;;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
    }

    listen &#91;::]:443 ssl ipv6only=on; # managed by Certbot
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/&lt;Your Domain Name&gt;/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/&lt;Your Domain Name&gt;/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}

server {
    if ($host = &lt;Your Domain Name&gt;) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    listen 80;
    listen &#91;::]:80;
    server_name &lt;Your Domain Name&gt;;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}</code></pre>

<p>After writing this configuration, restart Nginx. You will find that you can access this website as HTTPS.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>To make it easy, you can use <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag">LinuxServer SWAG Docker image</a> to use Nginx and Certbot.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="update">Update</h2>

<p>After posting this post on Twitter, there is an account that suggests I install <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/blog/openvscode-server-launch">Open Server on the Gitpod’s repo</a>. I install on my own VPS server. I found that it is better than code-server. I don’t need to use the apt-get command to install, and I don’t need to config in the config.yml file like code-server anymore.</p>

<p>However, one thing you should consider is security. First, I choose to apply Nginx for the reverse proxy shown above, but you have to change the port from 8080 to 3000. Second, I apply authentication on the Nginx side. Third, I use HTTPS instead of HTTP to make my code environment more secure.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I needed to have a remote development server, and I found a cheaper way to apply. I considered registering the VPS and installing code-server, Nginx, and Certbot to allow accessing code-server with HTTPS. I found it more convenient to develop from the laptop or the tablet. I do not need to install to take more spaces anymore. I can save many hours running on the laptop’s battery.</p>

<p>For anyone reading this, I recommend this way.</p>
